# Gavin's Mod v1.3

## -- NOTE --

If you are upgrading from v1.2 or before, you may need to delete/rename your
settings file located in `.minecraft/mods/gavinsmod/settings.json`. This *should* be done
automatically, but since I cannot guarantee I have tested loading the update with your
config, it may not be.
